# Concept

The idea behind these small tools is actually BIG.  
Wouldn't it be great to goto/do/setup/report/start/etc. being like simple commands with ALL details hidden behind?  
ALso it should not matter who and where from runs the comand?  
As big and right it might be - let's start with a few commands and experiment with them :)  

# How to use it?

1. Clone the repo
2. Add PATH to the repo in your shell
3. Use

# What is there now?

See bash scripts and instructions inside them.  

# Ideas for the future

1. Maybe Makefile could be better then bash scripts? It would be nice to type "make help" and see what is there inside.
2. How to integrate scripts with the shell even better (not by PATH but by having alias or something)?
3. How to provide auto completion to commands and arguments?
